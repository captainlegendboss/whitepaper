# Resource Distribution

Resource distribution in LandRocker is governed by a unique AI-powered algorithm that ensures fairness, scarcity, and balance in the gameâ€™s economy. The system dynamically allocates resources based on player activity, ecosystem needs, and the overall demand for specific materials. This ensures that resources are not overly abundant, preserving their rarity and value in the marketplace.

The AI algorithm adjusts to the fluctuating demands of players. For example, if more players are mining for a particular resource, the algorithm may limit its availability to prevent inflation. On the other hand, if there is a growing need for specific crafting materials, the system may increase the likelihood of finding them during mining missions, ensuring the economy remains balanced.

This dynamic distribution model guarantees that resources are finite, making each mining mission meaningful. Players must strategize on where and when to mine, and which resources to prioritize, adding depth and complexity to the game. It also ensures that external projects creating NFTs on the platform are backed by resources that maintain value over time, adding another layer of security and confidence for creators and collectors.
