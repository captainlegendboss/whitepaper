# Gameplay

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Gameplay 1280.318 (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

LandRocker's gameplay combines exploration, combat, strategy, and rewards in a way that captivates players from all backgrounds. In this game, you'll explore unknown planets, liberate them from alien control, and mine them to collect valuable rewards on a thrilling play-to-earn adventure. Your mission is clear: fight off enemy forces, gather rewards, return, and enjoy the results of your efforts.

At the heart of LandRocker's gameplay is your equipment - your weapons & gear will help you prevail in capturing planets from enemy control, and your Rover takes center stage in all mining missions. The stronger the Rover, the faster it can mine. Fuel is the key to success, as the more Fuel the player has, the further they can travel to uncharted planets filled with valuable materials and priceless crypto treasures. Materials and blueprints are used to craft NFT assets, Rovers and Planets, that can be sold on the marketplace.

You can also play LandRocker through a web-based platform, LandRocker Lite, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, allowing easy access and seamless play directly from your browser.
