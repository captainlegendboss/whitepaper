All Planets are integral parts of their respective universes, and each universe's rewards are validated through different blockchains. Every Planet is generated using AI, ensuring that their appearance – encompassing shape, color, and texture – varies each time, adding an element of discovery to every mining mission.&#x20;

When a player owns a Planet, other players can mine it in search of rewards. The best part is that **the owner earns a share of the profits** generated from the fuel expenditure of fellow players who embark on mining missions on their owned Planets.
