# Fighting Inflation & Revenue Decline

Combining combat and mining modes creates an interconnected system where players have specific roles within the larger ecosystem. Control over player participation in mining modes is designed to prevent inflation, maintaining economic stability by limiting the number of active players and ensuring rewards do not exceed sustainable levels.

The control over player participation in the play-to-earn mode serves as a strategy to combat inflation by preventing an excessive influx of rewards into the game economy. With a fixed amount of rewards available, the limitation on the number of players engaging in play-to-earn mode safeguards against inflationary pressures, maintaining stability within the in-game economy. Ultimately, this measure ensures that rewards generated by players in the play-to-earn mode do not surpass a sustainable level, contributing to the ongoing fight against inflation within the game.
