# DAO

LandRocker envisions transforming into a decentralized ecosystem driven by the collective influence of players and investors, actively shaping the platform's trajectory. Following the launch of LandRocker Pro, the community DAO will be established, providing a framework for community-driven proposals and voting mechanisms to enact new developments within the ecosystem.

The DAO assumes control over the community treasury, steadily accumulating funds through transaction fees. Empowering the community, the DAO governs the allocation of these funds according to the prevailing majority sentiment. This democratic decision-making process allows for versatile usage of treasury funds. For instance, the DAO may opt to allocate funds to high-value rewards, such as additional BTC or ETH incentives for the mining reward pool. Alternatively, the community can choose to orchestrate token buy-backs, utilizing these funds to enhance the LRT price for the benefit of token holders.
