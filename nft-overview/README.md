# NFT Overview

NFTs are digital assets minted on the blockchain network. Utilizing blockchain technology ensures guaranteed and transparent ownership of assets for everyone, providing players with true ownership over their digital assets. At the heart of the LandRocker ecosystem are four types of NFTs. LandRocker harnesses the advantages of both ERC-1155 and ERC-721 protocols in minting its NFTs on the Polygon network. This approach offers flexibility and versatility in the creation and management of digital assets, providing users with a diverse range of experiences and opportunities within the LandRocker universe.

Additionally, LandRocker implements a 2% royalty fee for each transaction involving NFTs within its ecosystem. This fee is automatically allocated to the original creator of the NFT, ensuring that creators receive ongoing compensation for their contributions to the LandRocker universe.
