# Weapons & Gear

Your weapons & gear are essential to your survival when fighting alien forces in Play to Liberate missions. Select your loadout based on the mission for the highest odds of success. Player loadouts include your suit, primary & secondary weapons, gear items, and companions.

Starter weapons & gear will be available to all players free-to-play, and these items can either be upgraded through experience, or replaced with more powerful NFT versions with increased stats.

NFT gear can be purchased on the peer-to-peer Marketplace or crafted using Materials & Blueprints found during mining.
