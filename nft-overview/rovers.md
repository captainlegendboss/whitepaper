# Rovers

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Rover 1280.318.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the upcoming update, a basic Rover (non-NFT) will be accessible **for free** to all users for all universes. However, paid Rovers (NFTs) have an advantage in mining efficiency.&#x20;

A variety of [Rovers](https://landrocker.io/marketplace?assetType=Rover), ranging between Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary rarity, can be purchased from the [marketplace](https://landrocker.io/marketplace?assetType=Rover), providing users with a wide range of options.&#x20;

The properties of Rovers differ across BPS (blocks per second), Count, Dig Radius, Dig Range, Power, Speed, and Storage. You can view each Rover's properties along with a description on the marketplace.
