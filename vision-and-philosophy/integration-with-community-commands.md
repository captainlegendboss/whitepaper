# Integration with Community Commands

While the Command Center currently utilizes AI for economic balance, it is evolving to incorporate community-driven commands. This hybrid approach empowers the community to influence economic decisions, fostering a more interactive and engaged player base.

#### Key Pillars:

* **Community-Guided Economic Balance:** The Command Center issues commands based on ecosystem needs while incorporating community input, ensuring resources are available without overproduction or scarcity.
* **Effort-Driven Asset Creation:** All NFTs are created through player effort, with the AI Command Center monitoring and controlling resource generation to ensure scarcity and value.
* **Collaborative Command Execution:** Players (as Commanders) can execute pre-published commands generated by the AI to influence missions, resource mining, and more.
