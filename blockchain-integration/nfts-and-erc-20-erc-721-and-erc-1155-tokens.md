# NFTs and ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 Tokens

LandRocker leverages multiple blockchain token standards to offer true ownership and secure transactions for all digital assets within the game. Each standard is carefully chosen to serve the specific needs of the platform, ensuring that both uniqueness and versatility are maintained.

* **ERC-721 NFTs:** In LandRocker, **planets** are represented as **ERC-721 NFTs**, which means each planet is **entirely unique** and cannot be replicated or replaced. These NFTs are non-fungible and provide true digital ownership to the player. As a player, you can buy, sell, or trade planets, knowing that you hold the only version of that specific asset in existence. This uniqueness makes owning a planet a prestigious and valuable part of the LandRocker universe. Each planet comes with its own distinctive terrain, atmosphere, and hidden resources, ensuring that no two are the same.
* **ERC-1155 NFTs: Rovers, Weapons, and other mass-produced in-game assets** in LandRocker are represented by **ERC-1155 NFTs**. This multi-token standard allows for both fungible (items that are identical and interchangeable, like consumables) and non-fungible tokens (like special rovers with identical stats but different owners). This token type is particularly effective for items that exist in larger quantities but still retain value. The ERC-1155 standard also enables batch minting and trading, significantly reducing transaction and gas costs, making it an efficient option for managing multiple similar assets.\
  **Why ERC-1155 Matters:** The ERC-1155 token standard adds efficiency and flexibility to the LandRocker ecosystem. For items like rovers or crafting materials that may be frequently traded or used in large numbers, ERC-1155 ensures that players can engage in these activities with minimal costs. Rovers may have common models, but through this token standard, players can own multiple units of the same type while still enjoying the security of blockchain-backed ownership.
* **ERC-20 Tokens (LRT): LandRocker Tokens (LRT)** function as the primary currency within the LandRocker ecosystem. Players earn LRT through completing missions, trading assets, and participating in events. This currency is used to purchase fuel, acquire assets, and power various in-game activities. LRT fuels the game's economy and incentivizes exploration, crafting, and player-driven transactions in the marketplace.
