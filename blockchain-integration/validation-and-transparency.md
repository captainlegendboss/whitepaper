# Validation and Transparency

Blockchain technology underpins the LandRocker universe, providing transparency, security, and fairness in every transaction and action. By recording all operations on-chain, players can trust the system to ensure their digital assets and in-game activities are protected and verified.

* **Mining Validation:** When players mine on a planet, the system cross-checks the blockchain to validate the resources mined and any potential rewards. This ensures that resource discovery is fair and based on real in-game activity, protecting players from fraudulent activity.
* **Immutable Ownership:** All NFTs, whether they are unique planets (ERC-721) or rovers and materials (ERC-1155), are permanently stored on-chain. This means that once a player owns a planet or item, that ownership is immutable and protected by the blockchain. Players can confidently trade and transfer assets, knowing that their ownership is verifiable and cannot be altered.

Crafting and Marketplace Transactions: Every crafted item and marketplace transaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring full transparency. Players can verify the history and legitimacy of any asset before engaging in trades, adding a layer of security and trust to the economy. This transparency also ensures that the marketplace operates fairly, with all participants adhering to the same rules of asset ownership and transfer.
