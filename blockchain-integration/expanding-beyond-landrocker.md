# Expanding Beyond LandRocker

LandRocker not only offers a robust in-game economy but also serves as a gateway for **external projects** to design, mint, and sell NFTs within the platform. Through the **ERC-721** and **ERC-1155** token standards, developers from other gaming projects can create unique or multi-purpose NFTs, which can be sold in LandRocker's marketplace and used across different platforms.

This interoperability allows external partners to tap into LandRockerâ€™s thriving community of players, collectors, and traders. For example, developers can create special rovers or crafting materials that are compatible with other games, providing a cross-platform utility that enhances the value of these digital assets.
