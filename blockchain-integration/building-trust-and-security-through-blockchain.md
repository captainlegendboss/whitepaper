# Building Trust and Security Through Blockchain

Blockchain technology provides **the foundation of trust** within the LandRocker ecosystem. Every transaction, from mining to crafting to trading, is securely recorded on the blockchain. This ensures that players, developers, and collectors can engage with the game’s economy knowing that their assets are protected and that all transactions are transparent.

* **ERC-721 for Unique Assets:** The ERC-721 standard guarantees that each planet is a one-of-a-kind asset, giving players full ownership and exclusive rights to that particular planet.
* **ERC-1155 for Versatility:** The ERC-1155 standard allows for both fungible and non-fungible items like rovers, consumables, and crafting materials to be managed efficiently and traded in bulk, reducing gas fees and making the trading experience seamless.
* **Immutable Ownership and Transparency:** Every player’s assets, whether they are unique or in bulk, are securely stored and transferred on-chain, ensuring that they retain full ownership and visibility of their holdings.

By leveraging the power of ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-20 tokens, LandRocker provides a **secure, transparent, and decentralized ecosystem** where every asset holds real value, and players are empowered to shape their own gaming experiences. The combination of these standards allows LandRocker to offer an immersive, multi-faceted economy, where both uniqueness and scalability are key to the platform’s success.
