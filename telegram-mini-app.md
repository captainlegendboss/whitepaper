The Telegram Mini-App is an innovative extension of the LandRocker platform that provides a mobile-friendly interface, enabling players to stay connected and engaged with the game even when they’re on the go.

**Core Features of the Telegram Mini-App**

* **City-Based Leaderboards:** The mini-app introduces city-based leaderboards, where players can compete locally within their region or city. These leaderboards track player performance in various in-game activities, and the top performers are rewarded with exclusive bonuses and in-game advantages. This regional approach not only fosters competition but also builds a stronger sense of community among local players.
* **Revenue Sharing**: The app generates additional revenue through **in-app advertisements**, and this revenue is shared with players based on their leaderboard rankings. Players who rank highly in the city-based competitions receive a portion of the ad revenue, creating a **sustainable revenue-sharing model** that rewards active participation and engagement.

**Integration with the LandRocker Ecosystem**

The Telegram Mini-App is fully integrated with the main LandRocker platform, allowing for a seamless experience between mobile and desktop environments. Players can track their progress, interact with the community, and even earn in-game rewards directly through the app.

* **Earn COIN Tokens**: Players earn COIN tokens through their in-app activities, such as participating in leaderboard competitions, completing missions, and engaging with advertisements. These tokens can be used across the main LandRocker platform for purchasing items, trading in the marketplace, or powering up their gameplay. The integration of COIN tokens ensures that mobile activity contributes to players’ overall progress and growth in the LandRocker universe.
* **Engage with Other Players**: The app enhances social interaction and competition by offering features that encourage collaboration and communication within the LandRocker community. Players can chat, form teams, and strategize with other gamers directly within the app, driving further engagement and fostering a more connected player base.

**Building a Community-Driven Economy**

The Telegram Mini-App plays a vital role in LandRocker’s vision of creating a community-driven economy. By leveraging both player participation and business partnerships through the app, LandRocker ensures that the entire community benefits from increased engagement and revenue generation. Players are incentivized to be active, compete in leaderboards, and share in the app’s success, while the app itself opens up new avenues for advertising and revenue-sharing opportunities.

In doing so, the mini-app expands LandRocker's reach, making it accessible to a broader audience, while reinforcing the core values of collaboration, competition, and economic sustainability that define the LandRocker universe.
