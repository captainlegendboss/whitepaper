# Core Components

* **Planet Liberation:** Players participate in missions to liberate planets, making them ready for mining and generating revenue shares for those who successfully complete these missions.
* **Mining Planets:** Once liberated, players can mine these planets using rovers and fuel. The amount of fuel needed depends on the distance of the planet and its galaxy.
* **Crafting Elements:** Players use mined materials to craft assets, enhancing their capabilities or creating unique NFTs.
* **Marketplace Trading:** Players can sell or buy crafted assets in a marketplace, driving the gameâ€™s economy and enabling strategic investments.
