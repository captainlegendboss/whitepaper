In battle missions, players fight to liberate planets from hostile alien forces. As you engage in intense combat, you’ll gain rewards for your efforts and contribute to unlocking planets for future exploration. Every battle is a test of skill, where victory can lead to both personal glory and shared benefits for the LandRocker community.

In mining missions, players use their rovers to dig deep into liberated planets, extracting valuable resources, crafting elements, and hidden treasures. Each planet offers unique elements to discover, and the more you mine, the closer you get to valuable rewards that can be used or traded within the game’s economy. Whether you mine solo or as part of a team, every mission holds the potential for incredible discoveries.
